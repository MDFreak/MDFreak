- 👋 Hi, my name is Martin Dorfner born 1955 in Germany.
     Great parts of my former work life have been embedded system programming with closed (and expensive) development systems.
     Now I'm retired and to some 'homework' in 3D-printing and µC-programming.
          
- 👀 In order to develop small and affordable µ-controlled units mainly for private purpose, I found all the nice open source stuff.
     I decided to start things using Visual Studio Code and PlatformIO for programming controllers in Arduino environment.
     
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to install a project with incircuit debugging like I know it from my professional work.
     I tried µC families Arduino and ESP32. I could get them run, but I could not come along with debugging until now.  
     
- 💞️ In my all trials I reproduced a lot of tutorials with example code and tested some libraries. 
     I found out that it makes sense to implement additional intermediate libraries for personell usecase access.
     I already have a set of such libraries in develoment state.
     As I'm new with using git and VSCode I try to setup my project system, that I can use libraries from every Project without extra installing.
     My goal is to have a independant repository in git for every library and every unit-project using that library.
     For every library I want to establish a VSCode project and drive the  git interface.
         
     My Intension for this system is the 3D firmware Marlin. The variation over controllern and peripheral is driven by makro defines.
     At the end I want to setup simular projects using different controllers and configure pins/peripheral with configuration files.
     This reduces the necessity to recode and test again.
     Additional advantages are implementation of board spezific pin mappingings and of control of footprint in memories.
     
     I don't blog to the community because ther is no specific ploblem to blog.
     If someone is touched with simular ideas, it would be nice to get in contact.
